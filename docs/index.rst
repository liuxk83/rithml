RithML: Machine Learning Algorithms
===================================

RithML is a machine learning (ML) library containing implementations for common machine learning algorithms, including those for classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.

Development
-----------
RithML is primarily built on NumPy and SciPy, although a few classes use CVXOPT for convex optimization. scikit-learn, while not explicitly used, is an inspiration for much of the functionality (e.g. function signatures).

RithML is developed by Kevin Liu (``kevinl9@yahoo.com``). Any feedback is welcome, through either `the issues page on GitHub`_ or email.
