RithML: Machine Learning Algorithms
===================================

RithML is a machine learning (ML) library containing implementations for common machine learning algorithms, including those for classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.

Development
-----------
RithML is primarily built on `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_, although a few classes use `CVXOPT`_ for convex optimization. `scikit-learn`_, while not explicitly used, is an inspiration for much of the functionality (e.g. function signatures).

RithML is developed by Kevin Liu (``kevinl9@yahoo.com``). Any feedback is welcome, through either `the issues page on GitHub`_ or email.
